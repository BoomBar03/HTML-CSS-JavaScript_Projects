       <h1><strong>About the Solar System</strong></h1>
       <p>Our planetary system is located in an outer spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy.</p>
       <P>Our solar system consists of our star, the Sun, and everything bound to it by gravity — the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, dwarf planets such as Pluto, dozens of moons and millions of asteroids, comets and meteoroids. Beyond our own solar system, we have discovered thousands of planetary systems orbiting other stars in the Milky Way.</P>
       <h2>Size and Distance</h2>
       <p>Our solar system extends much farther than the eight planets that orbit the Sun. The solar system also includes the Kuiper Belt that lies past Neptune's orbit. This is a sparsely occupied ring of icy bodies, almost all smaller than the most popular Kuiper Belt Object, dwarf planet Pluto.And beyond the fringes of the Kuiper belt is the Oort Cloud. This giant spherical shell surrounds our solar system. It has never been directly observed, but its existence is predicted based on mathematical models and observations of comets that likely originate there. </p>
       <p> The Oort Cloud is made of icy pieces of space debris the sizes of mountains and sometimes larger, orbiting our Sun as far as 1.6 light years away. This shell of material is thick, extending from 5,000 astronomical units to 100,000 astronomical units. One astronomical unit (or AU) is the distance from the Sun to Earth, or about 93 million miles (150 million kilometers). The Oort Cloud is the boundary of the Sun's gravitational influence, where orbiting objects can turn around and return closer to our Sun.</p>
        <p>The Sun's heliosphere doesn't extend quite as far. The heliosphere is the bubble created by the solar wind—a stream of electrically charged gas blowing outward from the Sun in all directions. The boundary where the solar wind is abruptly slowed by pressure from interstellar gases is called the termination shock. This edge occurs between 80-100 astronomical units.</p>

         <br>
      <p>The order and arrangement of the planets and other bodies in our solar system is due to the way the solar system formed. Nearest the Sun, only rocky material could withstand the heat when the solar system was young. For this reason, the first four planets—Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars—are terrestrial planets. They're small with solid, rocky surfaces.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, materials we are used to seeing as ice, liquid or gas settled in the outer regions of the young solar system. Gravity pulled these materials together, and that is where we find gas giants Jupiter and Saturn and ice giants Uranus and Neptune.</p>

          <h2 style="color:grey">Planets</h2>
          <p style="font-size:25px;"><strong>Inner planets</strong>-The four terrestrial or inner planets have dense, rocky compositions, few or no moons, and no ring systems.</p>
          
          <p class="lead" style="font-size:25px;">1.Mercury</p>
          <p>Mercury (0.4 AU from the Sun) is the closest planet to the Sun and on average, all seven other planets. The smallest planet in the Solar System, Mercury has no natural satellites. Besides impact craters, its only known geological features are lobed ridges or rupes that were probably produced by a period of contraction early in its history. Mercury's very tenuous atmosphere consists of atoms blasted off its surface by the solar wind. Its relatively large iron core and thin mantle have not yet been adequately explained. Hypotheses include that its outer layers were stripped off by a giant impact, or that it was prevented from fully accreting by the young Sun's energy.</p>
          <img  src="img/portfolio/Mercury.jpg" width="700" alt="">
          <br>

          <p class="lead" style="font-size:25px;">2.Venus</p>
          <p>Venus (0.7 AU from the Sun) is close in size to Earth and, like Earth, has a thick silicate mantle around an iron core, a substantial atmosphere, and evidence of internal geological activity. It is much drier than Earth, and its atmosphere is ninety times as dense. Venus has no natural satellites. It is the hottest planet, with surface temperatures over 400 °C (752 °F), most likely due to the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. No definitive evidence of current geological activity has been detected on Venus, but it has no magnetic field that would prevent depletion of its substantial atmosphere, which suggests that its atmosphere is being replenished by volcanic eruptions.</p>
          <img  src="img/portfolio/Venus.jpg" width="700" alt="">

          <p class="lead" style="font-size:25px;">3.Earth</p>
          <p>Earth (1 AU from the Sun) is the largest and densest of the inner planets, the only one known to have current geological activity, and the only place where life is known to exist. Its liquid hydrosphere is unique among the terrestrial planets, and it is the only planet where plate tectonics has been observed. Earth's atmosphere is radically different from those of the other planets, having been altered by the presence of life to contain 21% free oxygen. It has one natural satellite, the Moon, the only large satellite of a terrestrial planet in the Solar System.</p>
          <img  src="img/portfolio/earth.jpg" width="700" alt="">

          <p class="lead" style="font-size:25px;">4.Mars</p>
          <p>Mars (1.5 AU from the Sun) is smaller than Earth and Venus . It has an atmosphere of mostly carbon dioxide with a surface pressure of 6.1 millibars (roughly 0.6% of that of Earth). Its surface, peppered with vast volcanoes, such as Olympus Mons, and rift valleys, such as Valles Marineris, shows geological activity that may have persisted until as recently as 2 million years ago. Its red colour comes from iron oxide (rust) in its soil. Mars has two tiny natural satellites (Deimos and Phobos) thought to be either captured asteroids, or ejected debris from a massive impact early in Mars's history.</p>

         <p style="font-size:25px;"><strong>Outer Solar System</strong>-The outer region of the Solar System is home to the giant planets and their large moons.</p>
         <br>
         <p class="lead" style="font-size:25px;">5.Jupiter</p>
         <p>Jupiter (5.2 AU), is 2.5 times the mass of all the other planets put together. It is composed largely of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter's strong internal heat creates semi-permanent features in its atmosphere, such as cloud bands and the Great Red Spot. Jupiter has 79 known satellites. The four largest, Ganymede, Callisto, Io, and Europa, show similarities to the terrestrial planets, such as volcanism and internal heating. Ganymede, the largest satellite in the Solar System, is larger than Mercury.</p>
         <img  src="img/portfolio/jupiter.jpg" width="700" alt="">
         
         <p class="lead" style="font-size:25px;">6.Saturn</p>
         <p>Saturn (9.5 AU), distinguished by its extensive ring system, has several similarities to Jupiter, such as its atmospheric composition and magnetosphere. Although Saturn has 60% of Jupiter's volume, it is less than a third as massive. Saturn is the only planet of the Solar System that is less dense than water. The rings of Saturn are made up of small ice and rock particles. Saturn has 82 confirmed satellites composed largely of ice. Two of these, Titan and Enceladus, show signs of geological activity. Titan, the second-largest moon in the Solar System, is larger than Mercury and the only satellite in the Solar System with a substantial atmosphere.</p>
         <img  src="img/portfolio/saturn.jpg" width="700" alt="">

         <p class="lead" style="font-size:25px;">7.Uranus</p>
         <p>Uranus (19.2 AU), is the lightest of the outer planets. Uniquely among the planets, it orbits the Sun on its side; its axial tilt is over ninety degrees to the ecliptic. It has a much colder core than the other giant planets and radiates very little heat into space. Uranus has 27 known satellites, the largest ones being Titania, Oberon, Umbriel, Ariel, and Miranda</p>
        <img src="img/portfolio/uranus.jpg" width="700" alt=" ">

        <p class="lead" style="font-size:25px;">8.Neptune</p>
        <p>Neptune (30.1 AU), though slightly smaller than Uranus, is more massive and hence more dense. It radiates more internal heat, but not as much as Jupiter or Saturn. Neptune has 14 known satellites. The largest, Triton, is geologically active, with geysers of liquid nitrogen. Triton is the only large satellite with a retrograde orbit. Neptune is accompanied in its orbit by several minor planets, termed Neptune trojans, that are in 1:1 resonance with it.</p>

            <h2><strong>Asteroids</strong></h2>
            <br>
            <p >Asteroids, sometimes called minor planets, are rocky, airless remnants left over from the early formation of our solar system about 4.6 billion years ago.</p>
            <p>The current known asteroid count is: 1,076,353.</p>
            <p>Most of this ancient space rubble can be found orbiting the Sun between Mars and Jupiter within the main asteroid belt. Asteroids range in size from Vesta — the largest at about 329 miles (530 kilometers) in diameter — to bodies that are less than 33 feet (10 meters) across. The total mass of all the asteroids combined is less than that of Earth's Moon.</p>
          <p>Scientists continuously monitor Earth-crossing asteroids, whose paths intersect Earth's orbit, and near-Earth asteroids that approach Earth's orbital distance to within about 45 million kilometers (28 million miles) and may pose an impact danger. Radar is a valuable tool in detecting and monitoring potential impact hazards. By reflecting transmitted signals off objects, images and other information can be derived from the echoes. Scientists can learn a great deal about an asteroid's orbit, rotation, size, shape, and metal concentration.</p>
          <br>
          <img src="img/portfolio/asteroid.jpg" width="350" alt=" ">
          <p style="font-size: 25px;">Asteroid Classifications</p>
          <p><strong>Main Asteroid Belt:</strong>The majority of known asteroids orbit within the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, generally with not very elongated orbits. The belt is estimated to contain between 1.1 and 1.9 million asteroids larger than 1 kilometer (0.6 mile) in diameter, and millions of smaller ones.</p>
        <p><strong>Trojans:</strong>These asteroids share an orbit with a larger planet, but do not collide with it because they gather around two special places in the orbit. here, the gravitational pull from the sun and the planet are balanced by a trojan's tendency to otherwise fly out of the orbit. The Jupiter trojans form the most significant population of trojan asteroids. It is thought that they are as numerous as the asteroids in the asteroid belt. There are Mars and Neptune trojans, and NASA announced the discovery of an Earth trojan in 2011.</p>
        <p><strong>Near-Earth Asteroids:</strong> These objects have orbits that pass close by that of Earth. Asteroids that actually cross Earth's orbital path are known as Earth-crossers. As of June 19, 2013, 10,003 near-Earth asteroids are known and the number over 1 kilometer in diameter is thought to be 861, with 1,409 classified as potentially hazardous asteroids - those that could pose a threat to Earth.</p>

          <div class="column" >
            <h2><strong>Comets</strong></h2>
            <br>
            <p>Comets are cosmic snowballs of frozen gases, rock and dust that orbit the Sun. When frozen, they are the size of a small town. When a comet's orbit brings it close to the Sun, it heats up and spews dust and gases into a giant glowing head larger than most planets. The dust and gases form a tail that stretches away from the Sun for millions of miles. There are likely billions of comets orbiting our Sun in the Kuiper Belt and even more distant Oort Cloud.</p>
            <p>The current number of known comets is: 3,721</p>
            <p>Most comets travel a safe distance from the Sun―comet Halley comes no closer than 89 million kilometers (55 million miles). However, some comets, called sungrazers, crash straight into the Sun or get so close that they break up and evaporate.</p>
            <br>
            <img src="img/portfolio/comet.jpg" width="350" alt=" ">
            <p style="font-size: 25px;">Where Do Comets Come From?</p>
            <p>As theorized by astronomer Gerard Kuiper in 1951, a disc-like belt of icy bodies exists beyond Neptune, where a population of dark comets orbits the Sun in the realm of Pluto. These icy objects, occasionally pushed by gravity into orbits bringing them closer to the Sun, become the so-called short-period comets. Taking less than 200 years to orbit the Sun, in many cases their appearance is predictable because they have passed by before. Less predictable are long-period comets, many of which arrive from a region called the Oort Cloud about 100,000 astronomical units (that is, about 100,000 times the distance between Earth and the Sun) from the Sun. These Oort Cloud comets can take as long as 30 million years to complete one trip around the Sun.</p>
          <p>A comet warms up as it nears the Sun and develops an atmosphere, or coma. The Sun's heat causes the comet's ices to change to gases so the coma gets larger. The coma may extend hundreds of thousands of kilometers. The pressure of sunlight and high-speed solar particles (solar wind) can blow the coma dust and gas away from the Sun, sometimes forming a long, bright tail. Comets actually have two tails―a dust tail and an ion (gas) tail.</p>

          <div class="column" >
            <h2><strong>Meteroids, Meteors & Meteorites</strong></h2>
            <p>What’s the difference between a meteor, meteoroid and meteorite?</p>
            <p>They’re all related to the flashes of light called “shooting stars” sometimes seen streaking across the sky. But we call the same object by different names, depending on where it is.</p>
            <p><strong>Meteoroids</strong> are objects in space that range in size from dust grains to small asteroids. Think of them as “space rocks."</p>
            <p>When meteoroids enter Earth’s atmosphere (or that of another planet, like Mars) at high speed and burn up, the fireballs or “shooting stars” are called <strong>meteors</strong>.</p>
            <p>When a meteoroid survives a trip through the atmosphere and hits the ground, it’s called a <strong>meteorite</strong>.</p>
           <p style="font-size: 25px"><strong>Meteor Showers</strong></p> <p> Some meteor showers occur annually or at regular intervals as the Earth passes through the trail of dusty debris left by a comet (and, in a few cases, asteroids).</p>
           <p>Meteor showers are usually named after a star or constellation that is close to where the meteors appear to originate in the sky. Perhaps the most famous are the Perseids, which peak around August 12 every year. Every Perseid meteor is a tiny piece of the comet Swift-Tuttle, which swings by the Sun every 135 years. Other notable meteor showers include the Leonids, associated with comet Tempel-Tuttle; the Aquarids and Orionids, linked to comet Halley, and the Taurids, associated with comet Encke. Most of this comet debris is between the size of a grain of sand and a pea and burns up in the atmosphere before reaching the ground. Sometimes, meteor dust is captured by high-altitude aircraft and analyzed in NASA laboratories.</p>

            <h1 class="font-weight-light">Beyond Our Solar System</h1>
            <p>Our Sun is one of at least 100 billion stars in the Milky Way, a spiral galaxy about 100,000 light-years across. The stars are arranged in a pinwheel pattern with four major arms, and we live in one of them, about two-thirds of the way outward from the center. Most of the stars in our galaxy are thought to host their own families of planets. Thousands of these extrasolar planets (or exoplanets) have been discovered so far, with thousands more candidates detected and awaiting confirmation. Many of these newly discovered planetary systems are quite different from our own.</p>
           <p>All of the stars in the Milky Way orbit a supermassive black hole at the galaxy's center, which is estimated to be four million times as massive as our Sun. Fortunately, it is a safe distance from Earth, at around 28,000 light-years away. Our galaxy is one of countless billions in the universe, each having millions, or more frequently billions, of stars of its own.</p>
           <p>We call our galaxy the Milky Way because it appeared to ancient observers to be a milky band of light – like a cosmic roadway – stretching across the dark sky.</p> 
           <br>
            <p class="lead mb-0">Size and Distance </p>
            <p>All of the stars in the Milky Way orbit a supermassive black hole at the galaxy's center, which is estimated to be some four million times as massive as our Sun. Fortunately, it is a safe distance of around 28,000 light years away from Earth. The Milky Way zips along a galactic orbit at an average speed of about 514,000 mph (828,000 km/hr). It takes about 230 million years for our solar system to make one revolution around the galactic center.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="lead mb-0">Location </p>
            <p>The Milky Way is part of the Local Group, a neighborhood about 10 million light years across, consisting of more than 30 galaxies that are gravitationally bound to each other. Aside from our galaxy, the most massive one in this group is Andromeda, which appears to be on course to collide with the Milky Way in about four billion years.</p>
            <br>
          <p class="lead mb-0">Structure </p>
          <p>Scientists studying galaxies observed that the stars in the outer parts are orbiting the galactic centers just as quickly as the stars further in, a violation of Newton's well-established laws of gravitation. They deduced that something other than the stars and clouds of gas and dust known to comprise galaxies was providing extra gravity—lots of it. They calculated that there must be five times as much of this mysterious dark matter, detectable only by its gravitational pull, as there is of the matter we already knew about.</p>
         <p>The Local Group is only one of many, many clusters of galaxies, and they are all moving away from each other as more and more space comes into being between them. This means the universe, itself, is expanding. That discovery is what led to the Big Bang theory of the origin of the Universe.</p>
        <p>Scientists expected that the gravitational attraction of everything in the universe would put the brakes on the rate of expansion, and eventually the expansion would stop or even reverse. But in the 1990s, scientists discovered that the expansion is actually getting faster. The force responsible for this surprising acceleration was dubbed dark energy. No one is sure what it is, but one possibility is that it is energy contained within the very vacuum of space.</p>
        <p>Scientists calculate that there are at least 100 billion galaxies in the observable universe, each one brimming with stars. On a very large scale, they form a bubbly structure, in which vast sheets and filaments of galaxies surround gargantuan voids.</p>
